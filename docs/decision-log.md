# Decision Log

| # | Date | Decision | Rationale | Source Reference | Alternatives Rejected | Impact |
|---|------|----------|-----------|------------------|-----------------------|--------|
| 1 | 2026-02-19 | Focus Pilot exclusively on decomposition strategy (not all four mental math strategies) | Decomposition is identified as "one of the most important" and "one of the first strategies I teach." Source material warns against teaching multiple strategies simultaneously. Narrow focus enables deeper practice and clearer learning outcome measurement. | Four Essential Mental Math Strategies; Strategic Activities ("4–5 days minimum with one approach") | All-four-strategies MVP; Compensation-first MVP | Reduces Pilot scope by ~75%. Compensation, adding up, and constant difference deferred to V2. |
| 2 | 2026-02-19 | Use "make 10" (friendly numbers) as the primary decomposition method in Pilot, deferring place value decomposition to V1 | Make-10 is more concrete and maps naturally to single-digit addition within 20 — the core first-grade skill. Place value decomposition requires two-digit understanding which is end-of-first-grade content. | Four Essential Mental Math Strategies (examples progress from friendly numbers to place value); First Grade Guide to Double-Digit Addition | Place-value-first approach; Both methods in Pilot | Worlds 4–5 (place value + subtraction) move to V1. Pilot stays within single-digit comfort zone. |
| 3 | 2026-02-19 | Represent numbers as visual gem clusters (concrete) rather than starting with abstract numerals | CRA framework mandates concrete-first. Source material repeatedly warns against skipping to abstract. Gems provide a tangible, countable, splittable visual object. | Five Common Mistakes ("don't skip the concrete phase"); Strategic Activities (manipulatives before abstract) | Abstract-first with optional visual aid; Number-line representation | All game interactions are visual/concrete. Abstract notation is shown as a label alongside the gems, not as the primary representation. |
| 4 | 2026-02-19 | No time pressure, no scoring, no competitive elements in any phase | Source material emphasizes conceptual understanding over speed. PDB explicitly notes math anxiety as a problem. Competitive pressure undermines exploration. | Five Common Mistakes (procedures over concepts); PDB (math anxiety) | Timed bonus rounds; Star ratings per level; Class leaderboard | No speed-based mechanics. Progress is binary (complete/not complete). Celebration is universal, not ranked. |
| 5 | 2026-02-19 | Use browser-based web app (not native iOS/Android) | Chromebooks are the dominant device in US elementary schools. A web app works on both Chromebooks and iPads without app store approval or installation. Fastest path to pilot deployment. | PDB Constraint ("Must work on tablets — iPads, Chromebooks"); PDB Constraint ("Shippable MVP within weeks") | Native iPad app (better performance, App Store distribution); React Native cross-platform | Web limits some gesture fidelity and offline capability. Acceptable tradeoff for Pilot speed and reach. |
| 6 | 2026-02-19 | Defer student accounts/login to V1; use anonymous localStorage in Pilot | COPPA compliance is simpler with zero data collection. localStorage is sufficient for a single-school pilot where students use assigned devices. Eliminates authentication complexity from Pilot scope. | PDB Constraint (COPPA); PDB Constraint ("Shippable MVP within weeks") | Simple student login from day 1; Teacher-entered PIN codes | Risk: localStorage can be cleared by IT or browser. Acceptable for 6-week pilot. Monitor data-loss reports. |
| 7 | 2026-02-19 | Start with TTS audio narration rather than recorded human voice | TTS enables rapid iteration on narration text without re-recording. Keeps Pilot costs near zero. Modern TTS (browser SpeechSynthesis API or a service) is adequate for instructional content. | PDB Constraint (minimal text, audio narration) | Professional voice recording; No narration (text-only) | Narration quality may feel less warm. Plan to upgrade to human voice for V1 if pilot feedback indicates TTS is a barrier. |
| 8 | 2026-02-19 | Accept all valid decompositions (not just the "optimal" one) | Source material explicitly celebrates multiple decomposition paths to the same answer: "Both get us the same answer, both using decomposition, just different ways." Restricting to one path would undermine the core learning goal of numerical flexibility. | Four Essential Mental Math Strategies ("there's two different ways students might use decomposition") | Single-correct-answer per level; Bonus for finding the "best" decomposition | Level design must validate multiple solutions. Increases QA complexity but is pedagogically essential. |
| 9 | 2026-02-19 | Game name: "Treasure of Tens" | The name communicates the core mechanic (making tens), the reward structure (treasure), and the adventure theme. It's memorable and pronounceable for 6-year-olds. | Inferred — no source | "Gem Breaker"; "Number Ninja"; "Decomposition Diner"; "Number Bakery" | Name is a working title. Can be revisited before public launch if user testing suggests a different name resonates better. Hebrew name TBD — consider "אוצר העשר" or similar. |
| 10 | 2026-02-25 | Launch Pilot in Hebrew for the Israeli market; defer English and Spanish to V1 and V2 respectively | The founder's daughter and her first-grade class in Israel will be the first users. Launching in Hebrew ensures the Pilot is immediately usable by the target audience without translation friction. Hebrew-first also validates the game concept in a real classroom setting before investing in multi-language support. | Founder decision — proximity to first users; fastest path to real-world validation | English-first (larger market but no immediate pilot audience); Simultaneous multi-language launch (higher complexity, slower time-to-pilot) | Pilot requires Hebrew UI, RTL layout, and Hebrew audio narration. Codebase should use an i18n-ready architecture from the start to minimize rework when adding English (V1) and Spanish (V2). All UI text, narration scripts, and audio assets must be produced in Hebrew for Pilot. |
| 11 | 2026-02-25 | Implement RTL (right-to-left) layout as the default for the Hebrew Pilot | Hebrew is an RTL language. All UI chrome, text, menus, and navigation must flow right-to-left. Mathematical notation (number lines, equations) retains universal left-to-right convention. | Standard RTL localization practice for Hebrew | LTR-only with Hebrew text (poor UX, text alignment issues) | Adds RTL CSS/layout requirement to Pilot scope. Must be tested on both Chrome and Safari. V1 English localization will switch to LTR. |
