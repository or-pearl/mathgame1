### Introduction and Context

Good morning, happy Wednesday\! The sun is shining through and on this beautiful day, if you happen to be watching the day that the video is published, it is my birthday. I am 38 and feeling great today, so happy birthday to me\! In today's video, I really wanted to share how I teach double-digit addition and subtraction, both with and without regrouping. I know I had mentioned a couple of videos ago that I wanted to do that, and then I got sick, so last week I just did a little pop-in. But today I wanted to do more of an in-depth video sharing the exact types of lessons and the scope and sequence that we teach when we are teaching this very tricky skill to my first graders.  
To set the scene for you before we dive into this unit, right before this we do the place value unit, which is place value with numbers within 40 or up to 40\. That is how *Math in Focus* does it—that's the math program that we use. So in that unit, they are identifying place value, ordering numbers, comparing numbers, and identifying number patterns .  
We go right from place value and really understanding those numbers into this big unit, which is going to be a few weeks long and really get students adding and subtracting within those bigger numbers .

### Scope and Sequence

This is the scope and sequence. These are going to be the exact skills that we teach for this unit 3\.  
Basically, starting with Lesson 1 & 2, there are five lessons and then they're split up into days:

1. **Addition without regrouping:** We practice adding ones to a two-digit number, adding tens, and then adding tens and ones.  
2. **Addition with regrouping:** What regrouping looks like, then adding ones to a two-digit number with regrouping, adding ones and tens with regrouping, and also talking about regrouping with three addends.  
3. **Subtraction:** We do that the same way where we're going to subtract ones first, then we'll subtract just tens, and then we subtract both.  
4. **Subtraction with regrouping:** This is our more difficult skill that I'll talk about later.  
5. **Word Problems:** Lesson five is combining all of those skills with addition and subtraction story problems.

It pretty much equals out to be like a 15-day unit if we add a review day in and add some other skills that we need before we assess.

### Part 1: Addition Without Regrouping

**Day 1: Adding Ones to a Two-Digit Number**For day one, we are adding ones to a two-digit number. We always start with some math warm-ups. Here I'm really trying to focus on different ways to combine numbers, so making 10\.  
*Warm-up example:*  8 \+ 2 \= 10  We do the same with three addends, wanting them to kind of make that 10 strategy before adding on to make 14\.  
Then right away we are starting with: "What number is shown here and how would you add three to this number?"  24 \+ 3    
They'll know that it's 24\. I will almost always take some place value blocks or unifix cubes and do this on the rug while it is on the board 6\. Then we go over the different ways we can do this. I show students that we can **count on** from the greater number—put 24 in your head and count on three. Or you can do this with a number tape or number chart.  
Then I show them how we can use our place value blocks. We start by building 24 and then we add three. We always start in the ones and then we add the tens. So we combine the ones together, combine the tens together.  
And then this is where I teach them **Stack Math**. This is where I teach them how we stack the ones together, we stack the tens, and then we can go ahead and add these starting in the ones and then to the tens.  
*Class Example:*  36 \+ 2  I have everybody put 36 in their head and count on two more. Then I do this with blocks... we start on the one side. What's  6 \+ 2 ? Oh, 8\. Then we go over to the tens. 3 tens plus 0 tens... we add them together and our answer is **38**.Then I show them how we can also do this with stack math. I take that 2, stack it under the 6 because those are the ones place.  6 \+ 2 \= 8    3 \+ 0 \= 3  Our answer is always **38**.  
I do like to give students this little regrouping mat where they are going to write on this. So if it was:  24 \+ 3  I need to make sure my 3 is in the ones and not in the tens.  
When we learn to start in the ones, I always tell them that it's super important. So we always say **"Ah ah ah ah start in the ones\! Start in the ones\!"** That's our little dance that I teach them on that first day. It's cringe, but they enjoy doing it.  
**Day 2: Adding Multiples of 10**Day two is going to look basically the exact same except now we're talking about multiples of 10\. I remind them that yesterday we added some ones to two-digit numbers, and I say today we're going to add tens to two-digit numbers.  
*Example:*  20 \+ 20  We go through the same three methods: counting on by tens, using our place value chart, and stack math. We talk about how when we are adding just multiples of 10 we still need to make sure that we stack it tens over tens, ones over ones.  
*Example:*  17 \+ 20  We show them how to do it all three ways.  
*Example:*  25 \+ 10  Here it is with stack math.  
I have them go back to their seats. I will just shout out like a two-digit number. I'll say, "Everybody build 34."They build 34."Add 10."  34 \+ 10 \= 44  I just grabbed a 10 rod and put it there to make 44\.  
**Day 3: Tens and Ones**Day three is going to be the same exact thing except now we're going to have two-digit numbers that are going to include tens and ones.  
*Example:*  13 \+ 13  Or:  26 \+ 12    
*Example:*  14 \+ 25  When we are doing that we're going to count down by tens and then we're going to go over five to get to **39**.Then we go into using place value, starting in the ones, adding the 10, and of course our stack math.

### Part 2: Addition With Regrouping

**Day 4: Intro to Regrouping**On our first day of regrouping, our objective is: *We can regroup numbers into tens and ones*.  
We play **Mystery Bags**. There's going to be 11 to 19 unifix cubes in the bag. They take them out and place them on the one side of our place value mat. Once we fill up this 10 frame here, we can't have 10 ones in our one side; we need to regroup it and put it over here.  
*Demonstration:*We have 13\.  13  I explain we cannot have 10 here. I need to move it over to our 10\. I'm going to regroup this 10... and just shift it over. So is 13 ones the same as 1 ten and 3 ones? Yes, it is. We just regrouped and changed what it looked like.  
Then we play my favorite game which is **Race to 50**.Students have dice and cubes. Every time they roll a die, they build that many.Roll 1: Build 4.Roll 2: Build 3.Roll 3: Build 6.Now we have:  4 \+ 3 \+ 6  But once they get this 10, they have to shout out and say **"Regroup\! Regroup\!"** and they have to physically stack it and lay it down.  
On this day, I don't show them any sort of Stack Math. This day is just to get them understanding that concept of regrouping.  
**Day 5: Regrouping with Addition**When we get into this next lesson, we start by regrouping when adding just ones to a two-digit number.  
*Example:*Aiden has 15 toy cars. He gets 7 more.  15 \+ 7  A lot of students just count on and say the answer is **22**.Then I show them how to actually solve it with place value blocks 20\.  
*Example:*  28 \+ 6  We start in the ones. Students add all these together and see that once they get 10 here they need to move it over to the tens place. This is regrouping.Then I show students how to do it with stack math. 8 \+ 6  is 14\. We put the 4 here and the 1 up here.1 and 2 is going to be 1 ten and 2 tens, which is 30.To get our same answer of **34** 21\.  
Then we practice. This is where I show them how to regroup with base 10 blocks (making an exchange).  
*Game: Spin and Add*Students spin a number, say 29\. Then they roll the dice, say 1\.  29 \+ 1   9 \+ 1  is 10\. Take this up here.2 tens \+ 1 ten is 3 tens.Answer is **30**.  
Sometimes you might get:  34 \+ 4   4 \+ 4  is 8\. Do I have to regroup that? No, we don't have to. We only regroup when we have a 10\.  
**Day 6: Adding Tens and Ones with Regrouping**The next day we're going to add tens and ones.*Example:*  34 \+ 17  I will show them with actual base 10 cubes on the rug first, then examples with pictures on the Smartboard, then they go off and practice.

### Part 3: Subtraction

**Subtraction Without Regrouping**We follow the same exact type of thing.

* Subtracting ones:  37 \- 3 ,  42 \- 1 ,  19 \- 5 .  
* Subtracting multiples of 10\.  
* Subtracting both tens and ones.Can they stack it up properly? Can they start in the ones?.

**Subtraction With Regrouping**I hate teaching regrouping with subtraction in first grade... it's not a first-grade standard in Massachusetts but our curriculum likes us to expose students to it.My first day we're not actually doing any subtraction; we talk about what regrouping is. We can take tens and regroup them into ones to make them easier to work with.  
*Game: Race to Zero*We start with 40 or 50.Start with **40**.Roll a dice: **6**.Can I subtract anything from my ones? No.Students say: "Wait, we can regroup."We go to the Exchange Station. They get out 10 ones.Is  10 \+ 30  the same as 40? Yes. We didn't subtract anything yet; we just regrouped.Now can I take away 6? Yes.  10 \\text{ ones} \- 6 \= 4 \\text{ ones}  We have 3 tens left. The number is **34**.  
Next student rolls a **5**.Can I take away 5 ones from 4 ones? No.Regroup a ten into 10 ones.Now we have 14 ones.  14 \- 5 \= 9  And so on, until we get to zero.  
I do not have my students practice the algorithm (stack math) with regrouping and subtraction in first grade. There's just zero point. I only want them to do it with cubes just to get them to see when they have to regroup and when they don't.

### Part 4: Word Problems

We spend at least two or three days on story problems. I'm basically just giving them a bunch of different types of story problems. Sometimes it's addition with regrouping, sometimes without, sometimes just subtraction.  
*Activity:*I will give them a subtraction or addition problem just like:  24 \+ 13  Or give them one with regrouping, and they and a partner need to come up with their own story problem for that.

### Conclusion

It ends up being about 15 or 16 different lessons, so roughly 3 to 4 weeks. I have teacher-friendly slides and practice sheets linked in the description.
