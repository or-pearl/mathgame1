# Source Materials Index

7 pedagogical references informing the design of Treasure of Tens. Six are practitioner-channel transcripts from the same teacher educator; one is an academic textbook (placeholder PDF).

| # | File | Type | Why It's Here |
|---|------|------|---------------|
| 1 | `First Grade Guide to Double-Digit Addition and Subtraction.md` | Practitioner guide | 15-day scope-and-sequence for double-digit operations using place value blocks and "make 10" warm-ups. Shows the concrete-first teaching progression the game mirrors. |
| 2 | `Five Common Mistakes in Elementary Math Instruction.md` | Practitioner guide | Identifies five instructional anti-patterns (procedure over concept, too many strategies at once, skipping math talk, math anxiety). Validates the game's one-strategy-at-a-time, CRA-first, no-pressure design. |
| 3 | `Four Essential Mental Math Strategies for Early Elementary Grades.md` | Practitioner guide | Covers decomposition (friendly numbers + place value), doubles, and compensation with worked number-talk examples. Primary source for the make-10 mechanic (e.g. 9+7 → 10+6). |
| 4 | `Strategic Activities for Addition and Subtraction Within 20.md` | Practitioner guide | Hands-on make-10 board activities, print-and-play games, and fluency practice for addition within 20. Directly inspires the gem-splitting interaction design. |
| 5 | `The CRA Model: Concrete, Representational, and Abstract Math InstructionIntroduction` | Framework overview | Explains the Concrete-Representational-Abstract model with addition examples and stage-transition guidance. Foundational reference — the entire game architecture follows CRA progression. |
| 6 | `The Challenge of Teaching Math to First Graders.docx.md` | Synthesized overview | Compact summary of first-grade math challenges and four core strategies. Reinforces decomposition/make-10 focus and CRA pacing. |
| 7 | `Three Dynamic Math Review Activities for K-2 Students.md` | Practitioner guide | Three gamified review formats (Solve the Room, Math Mysteries, Scavenger Hunt). The "solve problems to unlock clues" format parallels the treasure/gem narrative. |
| 8 | `van de walle teaching developmentally.pdf` | Textbook (placeholder) | Van de Walle's "Teaching Developmentally" — authoritative reference on strategy-based math instruction. File is a placeholder; content referenced by other sources. |
