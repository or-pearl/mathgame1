Introduction

**1** Hey everyone, in today's video we are talking all about mental math. Now in kindergarten, first, and second grade, we spend a lot of time teaching students concrete skills—as we should—so they can develop that number sense and those beginning operations and really understand what's going on. But as time goes on, we do want them to develop their fluency and their mental math strategies.

Now in today's video, I'm going to share four of the math strategies I like to teach for my first and second-grade students, especially as they are heading towards the end of the year and as we develop our number talks. So in each of these strategies, I'm going to share how to do it, examples, and I'm going to explain a little bit about what it looks like when you are having this type of number talk with your students. So if you're ready to dive into this video, give it a like, subscribe to my channel, and let's get started.

All right, now by the end of first grade, your students are working with more than one **2** addend. They're working with three and four addends and they're even working on some beginning two-digit plus two-digit operations. They're working on two-digit addition and two-digit subtraction. So we want our students—well, of course, we want this to stay concrete, have them use all sorts of manipulatives—we do want to use our math talk time, our number talk time, to get them thinking about different strategies that might help their mental math move a little faster.

Now what I love is that students, if you write an equation on the board, they're going to solve it many different ways. I don't know if you've seen those Facebook posts where it's like "type out down below how you solved this problem" and it'll be like a two-digit or three-digit addition problem and the way that different people solved it, they're like so entirely different. Some people are using the standard algorithm, maybe they started in the ones place, carried the one, all that stuff. Other people broke it apart by place value. What's **3** going on inside someone's head is different person to person. So there are some strategies that your students are already doing but they might not have a name for it. During this math talk time is when you will actually go ahead and help your students name these strategies and also explicitly teach some of these strategies in case students want to gather them and kind of develop them themselves. So let's dive into the strategies.

Strategy 1: Decomposition

All right, mental math strategy number one is one of the most important ones to teach to your students and it is **decomposition**. Now this is gonna be kind of a "1A" and a "1B" because there's two different ways in first and second grade that your students are going to use decomposition. So let me go ahead and throw up a problem up here.

**Example 1:**  
9 \+ 7 \+ 5 \+ 2  
You might wanna use this exact example for a number talk with your first and second-grade students. Go ahead and throw that up on the board and then ask your students to go ahead and **4** solve it mentally—no paper, no pencil. And also notice how I wrote it horizontally; that's important for these types of number talks to kind of discourage from the algorithm. And then ask students, "How did you solve this?"

Now like I said, there's two different ways students might use decomposition:

* **A)** Make **friendly numbers**. A friendly number might be something like a multiple of 10, or a doubles fact, a doubles plus one fact—numbers that they can easily add together or subtract.  
* **B)** By **place value**.

**Decomposition Method A (Friendly Numbers):**  
Students might start left to right and they might say, "Okay, 9 \+ 7 \= 16." And then to make a friendly number they might decompose this 5 into a 4 and a 1\.  
So now they have 16 \+ 4\. They know that is easily a 20\.  
Then plus a 1, plus a 2 equals **23**.

Now that might seem like a lot of work but actually what you're doing here is you are just going **5** to be talking aloud a way to go ahead and solve a problem and many of your students might have actually done that. And when you give them time to explain their steps step by step, this is what it will look like when you write it out. This names the strategy and shows students what it looks like.

**Decomposition Method B (Doubles):**  
Now another student might have seen the 7 here and the 5 and the 2\. They might have decided, "Wait a sec, 5 \+ 2 \= 7." So in their head they're doing 9 \+ 7 \+ 7\. They know that doubles fact, that friendly number: 9 \+ 14\. And then they can go ahead and do this math however they've gone ahead and solved that to equal **23**.

Both get us the same answer, both using decomposition, just different ways of using friendly numbers.

**Example 2:**  
Now let me show you that other way we can use decomposition. Here's an example of a problem I might throw up there at the end of first grade or sometime in second grade and ask students just to think how can they solve this problem in their head—no **6** paper, no pencil.

47 \+ 19

**Method A (Friendly Numbers):**  
If we were gonna use decomposition for friendly numbers like we just did, I could see, "Wait a second, this is almost a friendly number right? All I need is a 1 here."  
So if I take a 1 from here the 47 and make this 46 \+ 1 \+ 19\.  
I can add my 1 and 19 to get 20\.  
And then 46 \+ 20\. Again easy numbers, friendly numbers: **66**.

**Method B (Place Value):**  
Now there's another way I can do this; this is with my place value.  
I could see that 47 is actually 40 \+ 7\.  
And 19 is 10 \+ 9\.  
I can break them apart by place value. So again in my head, this is me just notating everything that's happening in your student's head. So what I can do is I can take the 40 and the 10 to make 50\.  
I know 7 \+ 9 \= 16\.  
I get the same answer of **66**.

All right, so decomposition is one of the first strategies I teach to my students. It is a great one because it really shows that your students understand how to break apart numbers flexibly and how you know 47 is 46 \+ 1 but it's also 40 \+ 7\. There's just many **7** different ways they can make a number.

**Example 3 (Subtraction):**  
And also just to illustrate, decomposition also works for subtraction as well. I find that it's not as commonly used but it's still an important one to kind of showcase in case students pick it up—you never know which strategy is going to stick with students later on in their life.

Let's pretend we have:  
64 \- 28  
That might look pretty tricky. I can already see that I have to do some regrouping; it might scare students a little bit. So they can actually break this 28 into **24** and **4**.  
And then they could go ahead and do:  
64 \- 4 is going to equal 60\.  
Minus... so they've used that 4... minus the 20 (again some easy friendly numbers here) to make the 40\.  
And then they just have 40 \- 4 to get **36**.

So decomposition works for addition and subtraction.

Strategy 2: Compensation

All right, mental math strategy number two you're going to want to teach to your students is called **compensation**. I wrote that right up here and **8** this one again works for addition and subtraction.

**Example 1 (Addition):**  
39 \+ 4  
Now students can of course count up because 4 isn't too much higher to count up with, but what some of your students might be doing mentally without even knowing it is using a form of compensation. And when they're doing that they're saying:  
"Okay wait a sec, let's make this a friendly number. 39 \+ 1 is going to be 40."  
"40 plus 4 is 44." (Note: She adds the full 4 to the friendly number 40 here).  
"But we need to compensate for that one we added, so now we need to subtract it at the end."  
44 \- 1 \= **43**.

So instead of just counting up, we can just add one here to make it an easier number to add and then since we've added it at the end, we need to take it away. We need to make it zero, right?

**Example 2 (Addition):**  
Here's another example:  
37 \+ 58  
Now we could do this to either number, but to compensate and make this a little friendlier numbers we can do... let's add three over here **9** so we can make this plus 3\.  
We can make this 40 \+ 58 to get **98**.  
And then again if we added that 3, we need to just take it away. We need to take it away to make it a zero because if we add plus three and minus three to the same equation we're essentially adding zero.  
So when we do minus three now, we have **95**.

Compensation is a great way for your students to quickly use some mental math. And they could have done that with the 60 here too; they could have added two instead, added the numbers, and then taken it away at the end. They would have got that same result, that same sum of 95\.

**Example 3 (Subtraction):**  
Like I said, compensation also works for subtraction as well but it is slightly different. So if we're looking here at:  
64 \- 28  
Again students might be overwhelmed thinking, "Okay I know we have to regroup here, um, how can I do this quickly using some mental math?"  
Well what they can do is they can turn this number into an easy 30, a friendly number of 30, by adding two.  
So now we have **10** 64 \- 30\. That's much easier to do some mental math.  
64 \- 30 \= 34\.

But then when we're doing subtraction, this is important: **If we added 2 on this side of the equal sign, we actually have to add 2 on the other side.** We're not taking it away; we're not zeroing it out with subtraction. I'm gonna explain why in step number four. But just know that if your students are going to compensate using subtraction, if they added 2 here, they need to add 2 at the end to get their difference.  
34 \+ 2 \= **36**.

So again, compensation can work with addition and subtraction. With addition, if you have added something you need to take it away (or if you subtracted something you need to add at the end). And with subtraction, whatever you're doing—either subtracting or adding to a number to make it friendlier—you have to do the same thing on the other side of the equal sign.

Strategy 3: Adding Up

All right, strategy number three is only going to work for subtraction and this strategy is called **adding up**. And many of your students might already **11** know this one.

**Example 1:**  
20 \- 17  
That if I were teaching to my first graders, instead of having them line it up any other way, the adding up strategy works really easily here because these numbers are relatively close together. So I teach them to put 17 in their head and count up until they get to 20\.  
So: 18, 19, 20\.  
Sometimes if they're actually still drawing it they can go ahead and draw circles—I always tell them circles or dots—until they get to that number. So 18, 19, 20\. Three. Their answer is **3**.

Now when you are doing this number talk with your students, some of your students are going to say "I counted up" or they're just gonna say "I just knew the difference." But you really want to push them and ask them: "Well how did you know? What did you start with? Did you start with the number 17 or did you start with the number 20?" As you get used to these number talks and writing them down the exact ways that I'm writing them here, you can either ask them if they did their fingers to represent **12** it, you could draw some dots showing them how they did it, naming the strategy, showing them what it looks like. Having other students name somebody else's strategy is a great way for students to develop mathematical sense. This way they're able to actually reason and talk about numbers in a mathematical way instead of just giving you this kind of blank stare and they're just like "Well I knew it, I knew how to do it." I'm like "Well you solved it some way, let's talk about it."

So we do things like number talks all year long, but towards the end of the year this is what our number talks look like; they're very operation based.

**Example 2 (Harder):**  
All right moving to a harder one for maybe second-grade students or some students that maybe in a small group could do this in like first grade.  
64 \- 28  
Again I'm seeing I need regrouping, a little stressful. Let's figure out how to do this mentally with the adding up strategy. Now to represent it here I'm going to show you what it looks like.  
Here we have 64 \- 28\. And for the **13** adding up strategy, what they're going to do is students are going to add little numbers until they get from this number (the subtrahend) to the minuend. So they can do this in pieces if they don't know right away.

They might say: "Okay wait a second, let's... I know I can add two here."  
So we're adding up two, that's going to bring us to 30, right?  
"Okay now I'm at 30\. I still need to get to 64\. I'm not there yet. So I could add a big jump of 30 because 30 \+ 30 is gonna give us 60."  
"And then I only need to get to four. Okay, four more is going to get us to 64."

And where is the difference here, right? The difference is right here:  
30 (the jump) plus the 2 plus 4 more is **36**.

So in your students' heads once they've learned this strategy they might say: "Okay let me add up here so I can get to 30 (I know I added two there). I can do a big jump: 30 \+ 30 is 60\. Now I'm at 32\. Add four more... 36." Again this is gonna sound tricky but once your students get used to these strategies both seeing them and explaining them it's something **14** that sticks with them very quickly.

Strategy 4: Constant Difference

All right, and last but not least mental math strategy number four to teach your students is called **constant difference**. Now this strategy is basically like a "2B" strategy. Because just to show you quickly, when we were talking about compensation here and I told you about the subtraction one—it does work with subtraction—I told you if they add two here to make a friendly number, after they solve they need to add two again on the other side, right? So it's gonna be a compensation strategy but instead of adding the two at the end (so doing it on one side and then on the other side) we are going to do both of it on the side *before* we solve.

**Example 1:**  
So when I look at:  
61 \- 27  
Again looks like a tricky problem but I know I can make a friendly number here by changing this to 30\. And I can do that by adding 3\.  
Now I could use that compensation strategy, solve it like this and then go ahead and add it on the other side. OR I can just add 3 right now.  
So 61 \+ 3 is going to be **64**.  
Minus... 27 \+ 3 is **30**.  
64 \- 30\. Much easier to solve, much friendlier. Is going to be **15 34**.  
That's the difference. I don't need to make any adjustments now because I did it beforehand.

**Example 2:**  
Let's look at:  
50 \- 28  
Here I can go ahead and add 2\. Let's see, I can add 2 here to the 28 and I can add 2 here to the 50\.  
And this would be **52** minus **30**.  
To give us an answer of... for some reason I thought that was 12... that took like way too long to get a difference of **22**.  
So it's the same type of strategy but you can do it beforehand.

**Why This Works (Number Line Model):**  
When you're explaining why this works with students, an open number line is going to be an easy way to kind of model this. Um, again for them to understand kind of what's happening here. Why does this work? Why does 61 \- 27 give us the same difference as 64 \- 30?

And what you can do is you can show them here we have 61\. We're gonna do minus 27\. Just use like an open number line. We know the difference is 34\.  
So we can just show that here. What we're showing them is that if we go ahead and **16** add three here—one, two, three. And now we're starting here. So if we add three on *this* side of the number line and then we also add three on *this* side of the number line, our hop from one to the other is still going to be the same. We're just taking that difference, that you know arch here on the number line—our difference—and we're just moving it. We're moving it up three here and on this side. Or we're subtracting it if we're doing it both to the minuend and the subtrahend. The difference is not changing.

It's similar to thinking about how my mother and I, the difference in our age stays the same every year even though her and I get older, right? Like our difference, the difference between our ages is always the same.

Conclusion

Alright so those are four different mental math strategies that you should model and teach to your students and also make sure you are incorporating them into your math talks. Now the way I wrote out everything on my board here when I was explaining it to you is exactly how I would **17** write it out as students explain their reasoning. And as I explain my reasoning with my students, I would use the little carrots to show decomposition, I would go ahead and use an open number line to help make sense of it for students. But as students get used to these strategies and you are hosting a math talk with your class, ask them how they solved it, write down all the steps they're taking, and then name their strategy.

Now I hope this didn't sound too tricky to you. I will let you know that I was just with the first-grade classroom in March—let me say it's May now, yeah about two months ago in March—I was with the first-grade classroom that I work with all the time and we were able to do a bunch of those strategies. Students were able to name them, we talked about it, I wrote it down on the board. It can work, you have to feel confident doing it. So feel free to watch this video a few times, really understand each strategy before you teach it to your students, but then they'll be flying.

As always I **18** do hope you enjoyed this video. If you did please give it a thumbs up so I know, make sure you are subscribed to my channel and click that bell that way you're notified of every new video. See you in the next one, bye you\!

### Introduction

**1** Hey everyone, in today's video we are talking all about mental math. Now in kindergarten, first, and second grade, we spend a lot of time teaching students concrete skills—as we should—so they can develop that number sense and those beginning operations and really understand what's going on. But as time goes on, we do want them to develop their fluency and their mental math strategies.  
Now in today's video, I'm going to share four of the math strategies I like to teach for my first and second-grade students, especially as they are heading towards the end of the year and as we develop our number talks. So in each of these strategies, I'm going to share how to do it, examples, and I'm going to explain a little bit about what it looks like when you are having this type of number talk with your students. So if you're ready to dive into this video, give it a like, subscribe to my channel, and let's get started.  
All right, now by the end of first grade, your students are working with more than one **2** addend. They're working with three and four addends and they're even working on some beginning two-digit plus two-digit operations. They're working on two-digit addition and two-digit subtraction. So we want our students—well, of course, we want this to stay concrete, have them use all sorts of manipulatives—we do want to use our math talk time, our number talk time, to get them thinking about different strategies that might help their mental math move a little faster.  
Now what I love is that students, if you write an equation on the board, they're going to solve it many different ways. I don't know if you've seen those Facebook posts where it's like "type out down below how you solved this problem" and it'll be like a two-digit or three-digit addition problem and the way that different people solved it, they're like so entirely different. Some people are using the standard algorithm, maybe they started in the ones place, carried the one, all that stuff. Other people broke it apart by place value. What's **3** going on inside someone's head is different person to person. So there are some strategies that your students are already doing but they might not have a name for it. During this math talk time is when you will actually go ahead and help your students name these strategies and also explicitly teach some of these strategies in case students want to gather them and kind of develop them themselves. So let's dive into the strategies.

### Strategy 1: Decomposition

All right, mental math strategy number one is one of the most important ones to teach to your students and it is **decomposition**. Now this is gonna be kind of a "1A" and a "1B" because there's two different ways in first and second grade that your students are going to use decomposition. So let me go ahead and throw up a problem up here.  
**Example 1:**$$9 \+ 7 \+ 5 \+ 2$$  
You might wanna use this exact example for a number talk with your first and second-grade students. Go ahead and throw that up on the board and then ask your students to go ahead and **4** solve it mentally—no paper, no pencil. And also notice how I wrote it horizontally; that's important for these types of number talks to kind of discourage from the algorithm. And then ask students, "How did you solve this?"  
Now like I said, there's two different ways students might use decomposition:

* **A)** Make **friendly numbers**. A friendly number might be something like a multiple of 10, or a doubles fact, a doubles plus one fact—numbers that they can easily add together or subtract.  
* **B)** By **place value**.

**Decomposition Method A (Friendly Numbers):**Students might start left to right and they might say, "Okay, $9 \+ 7 \= 16$." And then to make a friendly number they might decompose this 5 into a 4 and a 1.So now they have $16 \+ 4$. They know that is easily a 20.Then plus a 1, plus a 2 equals **23**.  
Now that might seem like a lot of work but actually what you're doing here is you are just going **5** to be talking aloud a way to go ahead and solve a problem and many of your students might have actually done that. And when you give them time to explain their steps step by step, this is what it will look like when you write it out. This names the strategy and shows students what it looks like.  
**Decomposition Method B (Doubles):**Now another student might have seen the 7 here and the 5 and the 2\. They might have decided, "Wait a sec, $5 \+ 2 \= 7$." So in their head they're doing $9 \+ 7 \+ 7$. They know that doubles fact, that friendly number: $9 \+ 14$. And then they can go ahead and do this math however they've gone ahead and solved that to equal **23**.  
Both get us the same answer, both using decomposition, just different ways of using friendly numbers.  
**Example 2:**Now let me show you that other way we can use decomposition. Here's an example of a problem I might throw up there at the end of first grade or sometime in second grade and ask students just to think how can they solve this problem in their head—no **6** paper, no pencil.  
$$47 \+ 19$$  
**Method A (Friendly Numbers):**If we were gonna use decomposition for friendly numbers like we just did, I could see, "Wait a second, this is almost a friendly number right? All I need is a 1 here."So if I take a 1 from here the 47 and make this $46 \+ 1 \+ 19$.I can add my 1 and 19 to get 20.And then $46 \+ 20$. Again easy numbers, friendly numbers: **66**.  
**Method B (Place Value):**Now there's another way I can do this; this is with my place value.I could see that 47 is actually $40 \+ 7$.And 19 is $10 \+ 9$.I can break them apart by place value. So again in my head, this is me just notating everything that's happening in your student's head. So what I can do is I can take the 40 and the 10 to make 50.I know $7 \+ 9 \= 16$.I get the same answer of **66**.  
All right, so decomposition is one of the first strategies I teach to my students. It is a great one because it really shows that your students understand how to break apart numbers flexibly and how you know 47 is $46 \+ 1$ but it's also $40 \+ 7$. There's just many **7** different ways they can make a number.  
**Example 3 (Subtraction):**And also just to illustrate, decomposition also works for subtraction as well. I find that it's not as commonly used but it's still an important one to kind of showcase in case students pick it up—you never know which strategy is going to stick with students later on in their life.  
Let's pretend we have:$$64 \- 28$$  
That might look pretty tricky. I can already see that I have to do some regrouping; it might scare students a little bit. So they can actually break this 28 into **24** and **4**.And then they could go ahead and do:$64 \- 4$ is going to equal 60.Minus... so they've used that 4... minus the 20 (again some easy friendly numbers here) to make the 40.And then they just have $40 \- 4$ to get **36**.  
So decomposition works for addition and subtraction.

### Strategy 2: Compensation

All right, mental math strategy number two you're going to want to teach to your students is called **compensation**. I wrote that right up here and **8** this one again works for addition and subtraction.  
**Example 1 (Addition):**$$39 \+ 4$$  
Now students can of course count up because 4 isn't too much higher to count up with, but what some of your students might be doing mentally without even knowing it is using a form of compensation. And when they're doing that they're saying:"Okay wait a sec, let's make this a friendly number. $39 \+ 1$ is going to be 40.""40 plus 4 is 44." (Note: She adds the full 4 to the friendly number 40 here)."But we need to compensate for that one we added, so now we need to subtract it at the end."$44 \- 1 \= \\mathbf{43}$.  
So instead of just counting up, we can just add one here to make it an easier number to add and then since we've added it at the end, we need to take it away. We need to make it zero, right?  
**Example 2 (Addition):**Here's another example:$$37 \+ 58$$  
Now we could do this to either number, but to compensate and make this a little friendlier numbers we can do... let's add three over here **9** so we can make this plus 3.We can make this $40 \+ 58$ to get **98**.And then again if we added that 3, we need to just take it away. We need to take it away to make it a zero because if we add plus three and minus three to the same equation we're essentially adding zero.So when we do minus three now, we have **95**.  
Compensation is a great way for your students to quickly use some mental math. And they could have done that with the 60 here too; they could have added two instead, added the numbers, and then taken it away at the end. They would have got that same result, that same sum of 95\.  
**Example 3 (Subtraction):**Like I said, compensation also works for subtraction as well but it is slightly different. So if we're looking here at:$$64 \- 28$$  
Again students might be overwhelmed thinking, "Okay I know we have to regroup here, um, how can I do this quickly using some mental math?"Well what they can do is they can turn this number into an easy 30, a friendly number of 30, by adding two.So now we have **10** $64 \- 30$. That's much easier to do some mental math.$64 \- 30 \= 34$.  
But then when we're doing subtraction, this is important: **If we added 2 on this side of the equal sign, we actually have to add 2 on the other side.** We're not taking it away; we're not zeroing it out with subtraction. I'm gonna explain why in step number four. But just know that if your students are going to compensate using subtraction, if they added 2 here, they need to add 2 at the end to get their difference.$34 \+ 2 \= \\mathbf{36}$.  
So again, compensation can work with addition and subtraction. With addition, if you have added something you need to take it away (or if you subtracted something you need to add at the end). And with subtraction, whatever you're doing—either subtracting or adding to a number to make it friendlier—you have to do the same thing on the other side of the equal sign.

### Strategy 3: Adding Up

All right, strategy number three is only going to work for subtraction and this strategy is called **adding up**. And many of your students might already **11** know this one.  
**Example 1:**$$20 \- 17$$  
That if I were teaching to my first graders, instead of having them line it up any other way, the adding up strategy works really easily here because these numbers are relatively close together. So I teach them to put 17 in their head and count up until they get to 20.So: 18, 19, 20.Sometimes if they're actually still drawing it they can go ahead and draw circles—I always tell them circles or dots—until they get to that number. So 18, 19, 20.Three. Their answer is **3**.  
Now when you are doing this number talk with your students, some of your students are going to say "I counted up" or they're just gonna say "I just knew the difference." But you really want to push them and ask them: "Well how did you know? What did you start with? Did you start with the number 17 or did you start with the number 20?" As you get used to these number talks and writing them down the exact ways that I'm writing them here, you can either ask them if they did their fingers to represent **12** it, you could draw some dots showing them how they did it, naming the strategy, showing them what it looks like. Having other students name somebody else's strategy is a great way for students to develop mathematical sense. This way they're able to actually reason and talk about numbers in a mathematical way instead of just giving you this kind of blank stare and they're just like "Well I knew it, I knew how to do it." I'm like "Well you solved it some way, let's talk about it."  
So we do things like number talks all year long, but towards the end of the year this is what our number talks look like; they're very operation based.  
**Example 2 (Harder):**All right moving to a harder one for maybe second-grade students or some students that maybe in a small group could do this in like first grade.$$64 \- 28$$  
Again I'm seeing I need regrouping, a little stressful. Let's figure out how to do this mentally with the adding up strategy. Now to represent it here I'm going to show you what it looks like.Here we have $64 \- 28$. And for the **13** adding up strategy, what they're going to do is students are going to add little numbers until they get from this number (the subtrahend) to the minuend. So they can do this in pieces if they don't know right away.  
They might say: "Okay wait a second, let's... I know I can add two here."So we're adding up two, that's going to bring us to 30, right?"Okay now I'm at 30\. I still need to get to 64\. I'm not there yet. So I could add a big jump of 30 because $30 \+ 30$ is gonna give us 60.""And then I only need to get to four. Okay, four more is going to get us to 64."  
And where is the difference here, right? The difference is right here:$30$ (the jump) plus the $2$ plus $4$ more is **36**.  
So in your students' heads once they've learned this strategy they might say: "Okay let me add up here so I can get to 30 (I know I added two there). I can do a big jump: $30 \+ 30$ is 60\. Now I'm at 32\. Add four more... 36." Again this is gonna sound tricky but once your students get used to these strategies both seeing them and explaining them it's something **14** that sticks with them very quickly.

### Strategy 4: Constant Difference

All right, and last but not least mental math strategy number four to teach your students is called **constant difference**. Now this strategy is basically like a "2B" strategy. Because just to show you quickly, when we were talking about compensation here and I told you about the subtraction one—it does work with subtraction—I told you if they add two here to make a friendly number, after they solve they need to add two again on the other side, right? So it's gonna be a compensation strategy but instead of adding the two at the end (so doing it on one side and then on the other side) we are going to do both of it on the side *before* we solve.  
**Example 1:**So when I look at:$$61 \- 27$$  
Again looks like a tricky problem but I know I can make a friendly number here by changing this to 30\. And I can do that by adding 3.Now I could use that compensation strategy, solve it like this and then go ahead and add it on the other side. OR I can just add 3 right now.So $61 \+ 3$ is going to be **64**.Minus... $27 \+ 3$ is **30**.$64 \- 30$. Much easier to solve, much friendlier. Is going to be **15 34**.That's the difference. I don't need to make any adjustments now because I did it beforehand.  
**Example 2:**Let's look at:$$50 \- 28$$  
Here I can go ahead and add 2\. Let's see, I can add 2 here to the 28 and I can add 2 here to the 50.And this would be **52** minus **30**.To give us an answer of... for some reason I thought that was 12... that took like way too long to get a difference of **22**.So it's the same type of strategy but you can do it beforehand.  
**Why This Works (Number Line Model):**When you're explaining why this works with students, an open number line is going to be an easy way to kind of model this. Um, again for them to understand kind of what's happening here. Why does this work? Why does $61 \- 27$ give us the same difference as $64 \- 30$?  
And what you can do is you can show them here we have 61\. We're gonna do minus 27\. Just use like an open number line. We know the difference is 34.So we can just show that here. What we're showing them is that if we go ahead and **16** add three here—one, two, three. And now we're starting here. So if we add three on *this* side of the number line and then we also add three on *this* side of the number line, our hop from one to the other is still going to be the same. We're just taking that difference, that you know arch here on the number line—our difference—and we're just moving it. We're moving it up three here and on this side. Or we're subtracting it if we're doing it both to the minuend and the subtrahend. The difference is not changing.  
It's similar to thinking about how my mother and I, the difference in our age stays the same every year even though her and I get older, right? Like our difference, the difference between our ages is always the same.

### Conclusion

Alright so those are four different mental math strategies that you should model and teach to your students and also make sure you are incorporating them into your math talks. Now the way I wrote out everything on my board here when I was explaining it to you is exactly how I would **17** write it out as students explain their reasoning. And as I explain my reasoning with my students, I would use the little carrots to show decomposition, I would go ahead and use an open number line to help make sense of it for students. But as students get used to these strategies and you are hosting a math talk with your class, ask them how they solved it, write down all the steps they're taking, and then name their strategy.  
Now I hope this didn't sound too tricky to you. I will let you know that I was just with the first-grade classroom in March—let me say it's May now, yeah about two months ago in March—I was with the first-grade classroom that I work with all the time and we were able to do a bunch of those strategies. Students were able to name them, we talked about it, I wrote it down on the board. It can work, you have to feel confident doing it. So feel free to watch this video a few times, really understand each strategy before you teach it to your students, but then they'll be flying.  
As always I **18** do hope you enjoyed this video. If you did please give it a thumbs up so I know, make sure you are subscribed to my channel and click that bell that way you're notified of every new video. See you in the next one, bye you\!
