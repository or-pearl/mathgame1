**The Challenge of Teaching Math to First Graders**

Teaching first-grade math strategies is challenging due to the need to transition students from concrete counting to abstract mental math, while managing varying readiness levels, limited memory retention, and the necessity to avoid overwhelming them with too many techniques at once. Effective approaches involve using manipulatives, fostering number sense.

**Key Challenges & Solutions**

* **Overwhelming Quantity:** Teaching too many strategies (counting on, doubles, making 10\) simultaneously causes confusion. **Solution:** Dedicate 4–5 days to each strategy, allowing deep exploration.

* **Lack of Concrete Foundation:** Students often struggle to move from using fingers to mental math. **Solution:** Use the Concrete-Representational-Abstract (CRA) framework (manipulatives → drawings → numbers).

* **Developing Number Sense:** Many first graders lack a solid understanding of place value and,specifically, decomposing numbers between 10 and 20. **Solution:** Use hands-on games to group objects into tens.

* **Memory and Retention:** Students struggle to retain various math facts and techniques. **Solution:** Incorporate engaging, repetitive, and visual, techniques like songs and anchor charts.

* **Individual Readiness:** Wide variations in mathematical readiness make it hard to reach all students. **Solution:** Use targeted small-group instruction and math centers to address specific needs. 

**Core Strategies for First Grade**

1. **Counting On** **/Back:** A foundational skill for addition/subtraction, often practiced with number lines or, for example, "whisper counting" games.

2. **Decomposition** **(Breaking Numbers):** Breaking down numbers into "friendly" numbers (multiples of 10\) to make addition and subtraction easier (e.g., 9+7 becomes 10+6).

3. **Doubles/Doubles Plus One** **:** Using known facts like Using known facts like 5+5 to solve 5+6.

4. **Making Ten** **:** A crucial strategy where students learn to make a friendly 10 to solve more complex equations. 

The goal is to move students from relying solely on finger counting to having a flexible, mental, and conceptual understanding of addition and subtraction.
